- Missing Drug Coverage: 6
- Recommendations: 3

## ❌ Missing Essential Topics

- [ ] Anatomy: Hepatocyte structure and function\n- [ ] Anatomy: Bile duct system\n- [ ] Anatomy: Liver lobule organization\n- [ ] Anatomy: Kupffer cells and stellate cells\n- [ ] Pharmacokinetics: First-pass metabolism\n- [ ] Pharmacokinetics: Bioavailability\n- [ ] Pharmacokinetics: Protein binding\n- [ ] Pharmacokinetics: Hepatic blood flow\n- [ ] Enzymes: CYP450 system (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4)\n- [ ] Enzymes: Phase II conjugation enzymes\n- [ ] Enzymes: Genetic polymorphisms\n- [ ] Enzymes: Enzyme induction and inhibition\n- [ ] Enzymes: Drug-drug interactions\n- [ ] Diseases: Hepatitis (A, B, C)\n- [ ] Diseases: Cirrhosis\n- [ ] Diseases: NAFLD/NASH\n- [ ] Diseases: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)\n- [ ] Diseases: Wilson disease\n- [ ] Diseases: Hemochromatosis

## 💊 Missing Drug Coverage

- [ ] **Statins** - Hepatic metabolism and clinical considerations\n- [ ] **Metformin** - Hepatic metabolism and clinical considerations\n- [ ] **Phenytoin** - Hepatic metabolism and clinical considerations\n- [ ] **Rifampin** - Hepatic metabolism and clinical considerations\n- [ ] **Isoniazid** - Hepatic metabolism and clinical considerations\n- [ ] **Valproic acid** - Hepatic metabolism and clinical considerations

## 💡 Priority Recommendations

1. Add comprehensive CYP450 enzyme system coverage with drug interaction examples\n2. Explain first-pass metabolism with specific drug examples and clinical implications\n3. Create drug interaction matrix for hepatically metabolized medications

## 🎯 Suggested Study Plan

### High Priority
- Review CYP450 enzyme system and drug interactions
- Study hepatic impairment dosing adjustments
- Learn Child-Pugh classification system

### Medium Priority  
- Understand first-pass metabolism concepts
- Review drug-induced liver injury mechanisms
- Study liver function test interpretation

### Low Priority
- Advanced enzyme kinetics
- Genetic polymorphism effects
- Rare liver diseases

## 📚 Additional Resources Needed

- Drug interaction checker for hepatically metabolized drugs
- Child-Pugh calculator with dosing adjustments
- Case studies for drug-induced liver injury
- Interactive enzyme pathway diagrams
